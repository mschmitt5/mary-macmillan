## Milestone 1

### Feedback on Code

Your HTML code has no errors and looks good.
Your directory structure is perfect except for one thing. The README.md file is missing a short project description as per milestone 1 requirements.

### Feedback on Content

It's tempting at this point to keep your target market and audience broad to catch the maximum number of job opportunities. You will get better results by targeting your focus.

Imagine that you only have enough time and resources to apply for three jobs. How would you narrow down the options to only your ideal jobs/employers? The more focused the target market for your PWP, the better chance you have of getting noticed by the employer that you really want.

Overall you did a good job. Keep up the good work!

## Update - Short Project Description

This website will help me get a job in Santa Fe as a developer. It will serve as a gallery to showcase my projects and skills for potential employers.

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
These are looking good. Your layout plans are simple and concise, and your content strategy is reasonably well defined.  I don't see any big differences here vs. when I looked at your project earlier - so refer back to my previous feedback via Slack too. 

Your layout should be fairly simple to build using the Bootstrap Grid - I don't see any potential problems here and your page should be relatively simple to build. With simple/minimalistic page designs visual consistency and balance is key. Sophisticated use of negative space is definitely a skill, and I think you can employ it well here. These considerations can mean the difference between mediocre and  professional-level presentation, so keep these points in mind. I'm looking forward to seeing your design choices take shape. 

Your directory structure and code all look great. I think you're ready to begin development.

Build your PWP in a file named `index.php` inside `/public_html`. CSS, images, and JS directories should also be inside `public_html` and siblings to `/documentation`. We won't be using the `/documentation` directory any longer.

If you feel ahead of the curve during your development phase in the coming weeks, have a look at the [PWP Contact Form Doc](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/jquery-validated-captcha-form/) for an overview of the Swiftmailer integration.

Nice work. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development!
