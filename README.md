## Milestone 1

### Feedback on Code

Your HTML code has no errors and looks good.
Your directory structure is perfect except for one thing. The README.md file is missing a short project description as per milestone 1 requirements.

### Feedback on Content

It's tempting at this point to keep your target market and audience broad to catch the maximum number of job opportunities. You will get better results by targeting your focus.

Imagine that you only have enough time and resources to apply for three jobs. How would you narrow down the options to only your ideal jobs/employers? The more focused the target market for your PWP, the better chance you have of getting noticed by the employer that you really want.

Overall you did a good job. Keep up the good work!
