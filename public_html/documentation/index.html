    <p>Purpose: What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.</p>
    <p>Audience: Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?</p>

        To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
        To attract freelance clients.
        To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
