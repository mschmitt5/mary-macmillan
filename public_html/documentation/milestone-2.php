    <h1>Milestone 2a</h1>
    <h2>Content Strategy</h2>
    <p>First of all, I need a section with my name and a short description of what I do. (I still haven't decided on what to focus on in terms of front or back end, but hopefully I'll have a better idea by the end of this weekend.) I will also have links to my resume, linkedin, and github. It's essentially a business card at the top of the page.</p>
    <p>Second, I will have a more in depth "about me" section. This will have more specifics about what I'm interested in, what languages I'm comfortable with, and probably a bit about deep dive.</p>
    <p>Third, I will have a gallery/portfolio section. I've updated this to showcase only my capstone. I would like a photo of the project to be able to click on and take you to the project (no enlargement of photo, etc).</p>
    <p>I'll also have a "contact me" section. There will be fields for the person to fill in their information and email as well as a message.</p>
